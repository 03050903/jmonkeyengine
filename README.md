jmonkeyengine
=============

jMonkeyEngine 3 was made especially for game developers who want to create 3D games with modern technology standards. The software is programmed entirely in Java, intended for wide accessibility.

The engine is used by several commercial game studios as well as university (game-) classes. While its old 2.0 branch is now only community supported, the 3.0 branch is quickly emerging as a full-fledged game development environment for a wide range of developers.
